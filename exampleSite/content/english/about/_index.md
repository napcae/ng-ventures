I’m not just a technical advisor; I’m a partner in your growth journey. Born in Germany to Vietnamese parents, I’ve navigated the complexities of blending cultures—an experience that has deeply influenced my approach to both life and work. This cultural duality shapes how I approach challenges, blending technical expertise with a human touch.

For me, **technology is a tool**, but **people are the heart of every project**. Whether collaborating with **founders**, **engineering teams**, or helping **companies scale** their technology, I focus on delivering solutions that go beyond the tech. I help teams cut through the noise, make confident decisions, and build technology that serves both their immediate needs and long-term goals.

## **My Approach: Bridging Technology and People for Sustainable Growth**

With over 15 years of experience across **startups**, **enterprises**, and various industries, I’ve learned that **great solutions** emerge from understanding both the **human and technical aspects**. My specialties include:

- **DevOps processes** to streamline development and operations
- **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** to enhance reliability and scalability
- **Building platform teams** to improve infrastructure and developer productivity
- **Optimizing cloud infrastructure**  
- **Enhancing cybersecurity**  
- **Boosting developer velocity**

I don’t just create solutions for systems; I create **human-centered solutions** that drive **sustainable growth**. I work with teams to improve **security**, reduce **costs**, and build **robust technology foundations**. My goal is always to deliver scalable systems that support people, not just tech stacks.

## **What Drives Me: Impactful Solutions for People and the Planet**

I’m deeply committed to creating solutions that benefit both **people** and the **planet**. Whether I’m helping companies **reduce cloud infrastructure costs** or implementing **green tech strategies**, I prioritize sustainability at every step. The work I do and the companies I support aim to leave a positive impact on the world, both environmentally and socially.

I’m also passionate about supporting **migrant founders**, particularly in the **green tech** space. Having personally experienced the challenges of building a business in a foreign culture, I focus on helping **migrant entrepreneurs** overcome the unique obstacles they face in scaling their **tech companies**. My mission is to guide them through growing pains and help them align their **technology strategy** with their values.

## **Why I’m Different: A Human-Centered, Resourceful Approach**

Here’s why my approach stands out:

- **Human-Centered Solutions**: I don’t just focus on the technology—I prioritize the people who will use it. This ensures the solutions I create align with **team dynamics**, long-term goals, and your company’s vision.  
- **Resourceful Problem Solving**: Growing up navigating two cultures, I bring creativity and resourcefulness to every challenge, delivering innovative solutions that make the most of available resources.  
- **Proven Technical Expertise**: I’ve helped **SaaS companies** reduce **server costs** by up to 50%, optimized **security protocols**, and scaled businesses successfully—all while keeping **people and values** at the core of the solution.  
- **Sustainability-Focused**: From cloud infrastructure to green tech, I design solutions that minimize environmental impact while driving **business growth** and resilience.

## **Who I Help: Empowering Founders and Engineering Teams**

I specialize in helping **founders** and **engineering leaders** in **small product companies**, particularly in the **climate tech** sector & **B2B** space. These teams often face growing pains around:

- **Software delivery**
- **Security challenges**
- **Infrastructure scaling**
- **Building and managing platform teams**
- **Implementing DevOps practices**
- **Ensuring reliability through SRE processes**

I guide these teams past bottlenecks, optimize their **tech stacks**, and help build **scalable, sustainable systems** that grow with them.

If you’re a **migrant founder** or a **team** looking to scale, let’s talk about how I can help you create **solutions** that solve **technical challenges** while supporting your **team**, **values**, and **vision**.
