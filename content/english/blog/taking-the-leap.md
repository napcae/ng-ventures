## Homo sapiens. Sapiens—from the word wisdom.

We’re the only species that knows, with absolute certainty, that someday we’re going to die. Maybe that’s a burden, or maybe it’s a gift—one only we get to experience. For me, that awareness has become a quiet driver, something that constantly hums in the background, nudging me to ask: *What do I want to do with the time I’ve been given?*

And that’s why, today, I’m here—on a flight to Vietnam. No return ticket. There’s no dramatic story behind it, no escape from a life in ruins. I’m not running away; I’m running *towards*. There’s this pull, an instinct to charge headfirst into the unknown known. Vietnam is a part of me. I’m German-Vietnamese—not just one, not just the other. Both. And by extension, I feel like a citizen of the world.

Some people asked me how I made this leap. Not a lot stopped to ask *why*. So that’s what I want to write about today, 30,000 feet above the ground.

### **The Mindset Behind the Leap**

#### Friends, Family, and Gratitude
I didn’t grow up poor, but I wasn’t born into wealth either. What I *do* feel rich in is relationships. My friends, my family, the people who’ve shown up for me when it mattered—these connections are priceless. Strip away everything else: the achievements, the possessions, the noise. What crystallizes is this one truth: we’re remembered not for what we had, but for how we made others feel.

#### Autonomy and Privilege
I was lucky to be born in Germany—an economic and social paradise where opportunities are abundant. Berlin, with all its contradictions, gave me this sense early on: I didn’t just belong to the city, or to Germany. I belonged to the world.

Curiosity led me to software. Mastering its creation and operation taught me freedom—both in mind and in practice. There’s a magic in systems thinking, in learning how to take something chaotic and turn it into something predictable and resilient. That process was addicting.

Even now, as I step away from the realm of code, that mastery—this willingness to dive into gaps and hiccups in my understanding—comes with me. One thing I know for sure: if you love what you do, and you have autonomy in how you do it, the possibilities are endless.

#### Mental Health and Presence
This part took me years to figure out. I spent so much of my life chasing goals, convincing myself I’d be happy *when* I got that next achievement, that next big milestone. But happiness doesn’t live in some far-off future.

Depression taught me that. It still teaches me. But presence—the ability to sit with myself and truly *be*—is what changed everything.

It didn’t happen overnight. It’s been a journey of learning and unlearning. Step by step, I’ve moved away from the predictable patterns of distributed systems—the reliable world of computers and logic—to the unpredictable, messy world of us, humans.

### **Why Vietnam?**

So here I am, on this flight. Vietnam isn’t just a place on the map for me; it’s a piece of who I am. For as long as I can remember, I’ve dreamed of being based in Asia. This decision didn’t come from nowhere—it’s been years in the making. Little steps. Little leaps.

And yes, I’m scared. But I’m also ready. Ready to explore Vietnam’s hidden gems—the mountains, rivers, lakes. Ready to connect with people, build something meaningful, and grow in ways I haven’t yet imagined.



---

### **The Bigger Vision**

This isn’t just about me. I want this journey to inspire others—people who feel stuck, who are afraid to take that next step. The truth is: hard things are the ones that help you grow. Growth hurts. Change is uncomfortable. But when you embrace that discomfort, something incredible happens.

You already know everything you need to know. The only thing left is action.

### **The Invitation**

Vietnam isn’t just my next chapter—it’s an adventure I want to share. If you’ve been dreaming of visiting, I want to help you make it happen. Imagine cycling through lush valleys, hiking hidden trails, or paragliding over breathtaking landscapes. Let’s discover the heart of Vietnam together.

Reach out if you’re ready for your own ephemeral adventure. Let’s climb, hike, and explore the unknown, together.

### **A Closing Reflection**

In the end, we all become dust. The same cosmic dust that formed from an exploding death star. A supernova. We’re not here forever, but that’s what makes this journey so precious.

I’m diving headfirst into this unknown, and I want to remind you: life’s biggest shifts don’t come from waiting. They come from stepping forward, no matter how uncertain the ground feels.
