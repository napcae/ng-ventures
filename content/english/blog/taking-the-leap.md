## Homo sapiens. Sapiens—from the word wisdom.

We’re the only species that knows, with absolute certainty, that someday we’re going to die. Maybe that’s a burden, or maybe it’s a gift—one only we get to experience. For me, that awareness has become a quiet driver, something that constantly hums in the background, nudging me to ask: *What do I want to do with the time I’ve been given?*

And that’s why, today, I’m here—on a flight to Vietnam. No return ticket. There’s no dramatic story behind it, no escape from a life in ruins. I’m not running away; I’m running *towards*. There’s this pull, an instinct to charge headfirst into the unknown. Vietnam is a part of me. I’m German-Vietnamese—not just one, not just the other. Both. And by extension, I feel like a citizen of the world.

Some people asked me how I made this leap. Not a lot stopped to ask *why*. So that’s what I want to write about today, 30,000 feet above the ground.

### **The Mindset Behind the Leap**

#### Friends, Family, and Gratitude
I didn’t grow up poor, but I wasn’t born into wealth either. What I *do* feel rich in is relationships. My friends, my family, the people who’ve shown up for me when it mattered—these connections are priceless. Strip away everything else: the achievements, the possessions, the noise. What crystallizes is this one truth: we’re remembered not for what we had, but for how we made others feel.

There’s a moment that stands out for me—a time when a good friend offered honest feedback during one of my passive-aggressive episodes. It wasn’t the first time this had happened, but having someone hold a mirror up to my behavior was hard to ignore. I realized that actions have consequences and that I needed to take responsibility for my impact on others. In that moment, I decided things had to change.

**Actionable Insight**: Consider seeking constructive feedback from trusted friends or colleagues. It can be uncomfortable but invaluable for personal growth. Start by asking specific questions about your behavior and how it affects those around you.


#### Autonomy and Privilege
Transitioning from personal relationships to broader themes of autonomy and privilege, I reflect on my upbringing in Germany—an economic and social paradise where opportunities are abundant. Berlin, with all its contradictions, instilled in me early on that I didn’t just belong to the city or Germany; I belonged to the world.

Curiosity led me to software. Mastering its creation and operation taught me freedom—both in mind and in practice. There’s a unique satisfaction in systems thinking: learning how to take chaos and create something resilient.

Even now, as I step away from code, that mastery—this willingness to dive into gaps in my understanding—stays with me. One thing I know for sure: if you love what you do and have autonomy in how you do it, you can create endless possibilities.

There was a moment when software truly gave me purpose—I built infrastructure designed to guide people toward their best selves. This work was transformative; it allowed me moments of reflection amidst life’s chaos.

**Actionable Insight**: Identify areas where you can apply your skills for meaningful projects or causes. This can provide clarity and direction in your career. Consider volunteering or collaborating on projects that align with your values and interests.


#### Mental Health and Presence
As I moved through these experiences, I learned valuable lessons about mental health and presence. This part took me years to figure out. For so long, I chased goals, thinking happiness lay in future achievements. But true contentment doesn’t reside in distant milestones.

Depression taught me this lesson repeatedly. But presence—the ability to sit with myself and truly *be*—changed everything.

It didn’t happen overnight; it’s been a journey of learning and unlearning. Step by step, I’ve moved from the predictable patterns of systems—the reliable world of computers—to the unpredictable realm of human experience.

There was a specific moment that marked a turning point for me: while in Tenerife, waking up by the sea and focusing on gratitude helped me overcome long-standing shadows of doubt and despair.

**Actionable Insight**: Practice mindfulness daily—even if just for a few minutes—to cultivate presence and awareness in your life. Start with simple breathing exercises or guided meditations using apps like Headspace or Calm.


### **Why Vietnam?**

So here I am on this flight. Vietnam isn’t just a place on the map; it’s part of who I am. For as long as I can remember, I've dreamed of being based in Asia. This decision didn’t come from nowhere—it’s been years in the making through little steps and leaps.

And yes, I’m scared—but also ready—to explore Vietnam’s hidden gems—the mountains, rivers, lakes. Ready to connect with people and build something meaningful.

Over the past five years, my annual visits have deepened my connection to my heritage. Riding on a Grab motorcycle through bustling streets brought an exhilarating sense of freedom that made me want to dive deeper into this experience.

**Actionable Insight**: Embrace opportunities for cultural immersion wherever you are; they can lead to profound personal growth. Consider participating in local events or connecting with community groups related to your interests.


### **The Bigger Vision**

This isn’t just about me; it’s about inspiring others—people who feel stuck or afraid to take their next step. Hard things help us grow; change is uncomfortable but necessary for transformation.

You already know everything you need; what remains is action.

I could no longer behave irrationally or lash out; I had a responsibility—not just to myself but also to my team. This wake-up call forced deep reflection on my actions' impact.

Asking for help was daunting but essential for growth. During this time, Jon Kabat-Zinn's "Wherever You Go, There You Are" resonated deeply with me—it explained why meditation is crucial for navigating life's challenges.

Looking back at relationships I've damaged before this shift reminds me of how much I've grown since then.

**Actionable Insight**: Don’t hesitate to seek help when needed; vulnerability can be a powerful catalyst for personal transformation. Consider finding a mentor or joining support groups where you can share experiences and learn from others.


### **The Invitation**

Vietnam isn’t just my next chapter—it’s an adventure worth sharing. If you’ve been dreaming of visiting, let’s make it happen together! Imagine cycling through lush valleys or hiking hidden trails—we can discover Vietnam's heart together.

Reach out if you’re ready for your own adventure! Let’s explore the unknown together.


### **A Closing Reflection**

In the end, we all become dust—the same cosmic dust from an exploding star. We’re not here forever; that makes this journey precious.

I’m diving headfirst into this unknown and want to remind you: life’s biggest shifts come from stepping forward into uncertainty.

As I take this leap into the unknown, I aspire to become wiser and more grounded—transforming quick reactions into thoughtful responses. My relationships deserve patience and understanding; cultivating these qualities is essential as I embrace this journey ahead.
