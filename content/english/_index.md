    content: |
      I’ve worked across startups, unicorns, and everything in between. What stayed with me wasn’t the scale—it was the silence.

      Founders doing brave, meaningful work. Alone.

      This space is for them. For us. The ones building with care, not just speed. Who want clarity, not just noise. And a circle that sees them—before the pitch deck.

      Because real change starts with people. And people need space.


    bulletpoints:
      -
      - A global circle of SEA-rooted founders
      - For ethical, purpose-driven tech—longevity, climate, health, and education
      - Conversations that create clarity—not noise
      - "Energy flows both ways: you give, you grow"
      - Zero ego. Full presence. Real connection.
