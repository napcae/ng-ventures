A while back, I hit a wall.

On the surface, I was doing well—climbing, leading, achieving. But underneath, I felt disconnected. I pushed myself hard, trying to prove something. And still, the doubts lingered. I hurt people because I was hurting. I blamed systems, but the real blockers were in my own head.

Then life interrupted.
Losing my job forced a pause. Space opened. And with it came the question:
What am I really here to do?

It took time, humility, and a second break for the answer to land:
I didn’t just want to grow. I wanted to create the kind of space I wish I’d had—where people grow together.

That’s why I’m building [The Inner Circle](https://tally.so/r/31Rj7M) — a global network for purpose-driven founders.
We’re here to build companies that matter, support one another through discomfort, and lead with depth—not ego.
Because growth doesn’t happen in isolation. It happens in honest rooms, with people who won’t let you shrink.

My background is in scaling software systems and teams—from startups to unicorns, agencies to enterprises.
I’ve led across security, infrastructure, and engineering strategy—often at the edges where complexity meets human friction.
That taught me this: real change doesn’t start in the system. It starts in us.

If that speaks to you, [let's connect](https://trung.berlin).
Let’s build, reflect, and grow into what’s next.

In between, you’ll find me climbing rocks, cooking with friends, or somewhere on a bike.
That’s where I feel most human—and bring that same energy to the work I do.
