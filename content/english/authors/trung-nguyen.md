I’m not just a technical advisor; I’m a partner in your growth journey. Born in Germany to Vietnamese parents, I’ve learned to navigate between cultures, an experience that influences how I approach both life and work.

For me, technology is a tool, but people are at the heart of every project. Whether working with founders, engineering teams, or guiding companies through complex scaling challenges, I focus on delivering solutions that align with your values and team culture.

With over 15 years of experience across startups, enterprises, and a wide range of industries, I specialize in areas like DevOps, SRE, cloud infrastructure, security, and developer velocity. My goal is to create human-centered solutions that not only solve technical problems but also fit seamlessly into the bigger picture of your business goals and team dynamics.

## **What Drives Me: People, Processes, and Right-Sized Technology for Sustainable Growth**

I believe that technology should serve people, not the other way around. That’s why my approach centers on the right-sizing and appropriate usage of technology to ensure it aligns with both your team’s needs and long-term business goals.

Instead of pushing the latest trends or solutions that may not fit, I focus on helping teams navigate complex technical landscapes by optimizing processes and creating solutions that are both scalable and sustainable. The goal isn’t just to adopt cutting-edge technology—it’s to adopt the right technology that empowers your people to do their best work while supporting the processes that drive long-term success.

For me, authenticity and autonomy are key. Whether it's refining your team’s workflows or providing guidance on cloud infrastructure or security, I prioritize solutions that support your people, enhance their capabilities, and create an environment where they can thrive. Psychological safety is a key part of that process—ensuring that teams feel empowered to innovate and grow without fear of failure.

By focusing on the human side of technology—and the processes that drive it—I help teams achieve sustainable growth without the waste that often comes with over-engineering. Ultimately, it’s about balancing technology with the needs of your team, enabling them to scale successfully while staying true to your values and culture.

## **Why I’m Different: A Human-Centered, Resourceful Approach**

I prioritize human-centered solutions, ensuring that technology works for people and that your team’s dynamics and long-term goals are aligned with the solutions I create. I bring a unique perspective to every challenge, shaped by my diverse cultural background, helping me find creative solutions to complex problems and do more with less.

My technical expertise is proven by the results: from optimizing cloud infrastructure to improving security practices, I’ve helped businesses save costs and scale effectively while keeping people at the heart of every solution.

## **Who I Help: Empowering Founders and Engineering Leaders**

I work with founders and engineering leaders in green tech and B2B, helping them scale their companies effectively and sustainably. Whether optimizing software delivery, security, or infrastructure scaling, I provide the tools and strategies that ensure teams can grow while maintaining their authentic values.

My focus is on creating solutions that empower teams to make confident decisions and scale with autonomy. I believe in fostering psychological safety in every collaboration, especially in remote teams, where clear communication and trust are key.

If you’re looking to scale your business with solutions that support your team, values, and vision, let’s talk!

In my spare time, you’ll find me rock climbing, bikepacking, hiking, or cooking—activities that keep me grounded and reflect the same passion and perseverance I bring to my work.
