A while back, I found myself at a crossroads. I had spent years pushing forward, working hard, chasing success, and trying to prove myself. But despite the achievements and experiences, I felt stuck. Imposter syndrome, self-doubt, and a distorted self-image weighed me down. I hurt people because I was hurting. I was stubborn, unwilling to change, and blind to the fact that my biggest limitations weren’t external; they were in my own head.



Then life forced me to pause. Losing my job gave me space to reflect: What do I actually want? It took yet another forced break for me to finally accept the truth. I didn’t just want to grow; I wanted to create a space where others could grow too.

I’m now building that space — a community for Vietnamese entrepreneurs and visionaries who push each other forward, challenge their limits, and take action. Because we’re stronger when we surround ourselves with people who won’t let us stay small.

Through my journey of mentoring, traveling, endurance challenges, and tech leadership, I’ve seen firsthand that growth happens when we face discomfort together. Whether it’s breaking through mental blocks, overcoming fear in business, or reconnecting with our culture, I want to help create those moments of transformation.

Helping founders find clarity, focus, and purpose has become my mission.

If that speaks to you, let’s connect. Let’s build, challenge, and grow together.

In my spare time, you’ll find me rock climbing, bikepacking, hiking, or cooking—activities that keep me grounded and reflect the same passion and perseverance I bring to my work.
