## Stop Burning Cash on AWS – Save 30-50% on Your Monthly Bill

Too many companies waste money on AWS.
They pay for

* idle EC2 instances
* oversized RDS databases
* forgotten EBS volumes.

Every dollar wasted is money that could fuel your growth.

Imagine getting back that lost money quickly.

* With my fast, no-nonsense AWS audit, you receive a clear, actionable report in just two days.
* You will know exactly where you are overspending and how to fix it.

### How It Works:
- **15-Minute Call:** We start with a free, short call to discuss your AWS setup.
- **Thorough Analysis:** I review your AWS environment to find quick wins, such as resizing instances, removing unused resources, and fine-tuning autoscaling.
- **Actionable Report:** In 48 hours, you get a straightforward report that shows you where you can cut costs.

### What You Get:
- A simple, effective audit report that highlights wasted spending.
- Clear recommendations to reduce your AWS bill by 30 to 50 percent.
- Typical annual savings of $5,000 to $50,000.
- A risk-free promise: If I do not find at least 30 percent in savings, you do not pay.

Stop letting hidden AWS costs hold you back. Reclaim your budget and invest in what truly matters.
