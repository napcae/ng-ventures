You’re scaling, but your infrastructure is costing too much, slowing down development, or breaking at the worst times. Despite all efforts to optimize, your team still feels bogged down by inefficiencies, and your costs keep climbing without a clear return.
What if you could identify the exact roadblocks that are hindering your growth and eliminate them—without wasting more money or resources?
Imagine having a clear, actionable plan that fixes your infrastructure issues while keeping your costs low and your team moving fast. You’re not just patching things up—you’re setting your business up for sustainable growth.

## The DevOps Growth Audit is the solution
I’ll provide you with a comprehensive audit that identifies where your infrastructure is costing too much, where performance is lacking, and where you can optimize. I don’t just deliver insights—I provide actionable steps that will help you immediately reduce overhead and scale faster.

### Why me?
* I’ve helped numerous startups and enterprises optimize infrastructure, reduce costs, and improve operational performance.
* I specialize in cloud optimization, cost reduction, and scalability, and I’ve saved companies up to 50% on their cloud infrastructure.
* My hands-on experience in DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and security gives me the ability to find and fix issues from the ground up.

## Here’s how it works
* **Deep Dive Audit** – We’ll do a full breakdown of your infrastructure, costs, and performance. I’ll identify the areas where you’re losing money or causing inefficiencies.
* **Priority Fixes** – Using the 80/20 principle, I’ll identify the most important fixes that will give you the biggest bang for your buck.
* **Scalability Plan** – You’ll get a step-by-step roadmap for scaling your infrastructure sustainably and efficiently.
* **Cost Savings Report** – I’ll provide concrete recommendations on how to cut unnecessary costs and invest in areas that will deliver the best ROI.
* **Follow-Up Consulting** – If needed, I offer ongoing support to help you implement the changes and ensure your team stays on track.

## Pricing
The initial DevOps Growth Audit is priced at €3,500. If you choose to proceed with the recommendations, I offer follow-up consulting at €1,500 per month, which includes additional audits, implementation support, and ongoing guidance.
